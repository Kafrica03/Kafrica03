🇺🇦 UKRAINE 
CRISIS
Help Save Children in Ukraine
Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe, after Russia, and has an estimated population of 44 million. Sadly, children in Eastern Ukraine have grown up in conflict for the past eight years, enduring violence, shelling and being displaced from their homes. Today, fighting in Ukraine has forced children and families to seek refuge in neighboring countries, with more than 14 million people having now crossed the borders.
Ukraine’s children are caught in the crossfire of this adult war. It should never have come to this.
 Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential  humanitarian aid to children and their families. Your donation to the Children's Emergency Fund can help provide children and families impacted by the conflict in Ukraine and around the world with immediate aid, such as food, water, hygiene kits, psychosocial support and cash assistance. Together, we can protect children in crisis.

What is the current situation in Ukraine?
The conflict in Ukraine has caused the fastest and largest displacement of people in Europe since World War II. 
Heavy fighting, shelling and air strikes across Ukraine have forced nearly 14.3 million people to flee the country, with an additional 7.7 million displaced internally. 
Children are hearing explosions and they are being asked to flee their homes with just the clothes on their backs. The risk to their mental health and potential for long-term trauma cannot be underestimated.
The escalation in violence is also set to impact children in need across the world at a time when they are already bearing the brunt of the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis and the world’s worst hunger crisis this century.

Children on the move across Eastern Europe are at risk of hunger, illness, trafficking and abuse. Distressed children and mothers have been forced to leave fathers and husbands behind after authorities ordered Ukrainian men aged 18-60 to stay and fight.
Every effort should be made to find a diplomatic solution and avert an even more catastrophic war. Children must be protected from harm at all times.
